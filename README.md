# Nano Gameboy
Personal project to create games on the Arduino Nano, a ST7789 TFT screen and joystick.

## Current Games
- Snake 

# Notes

## Snake
- Pushed on 07/12/2022
- The delay is not good, i suspect it leads to some inputs being ignored, when the arduino does not recieve joystick input. Will aim to fix this for greater response in the future.
- Perhaps a functionality when the snake is eaten, leading to a smaller snake?
